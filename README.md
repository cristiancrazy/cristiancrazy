### Hi everyone!👋

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### General Biography
[🤷‍♂️] I am Cristian Capraro, actually a 20 years old CS student in [UniUPO](https://disit.uniupo.it/it) (VC, Italy).

I was an IT student of [ITIS Fauser](https://www.fauser.edu) (sited in Novara, Italy) for five years and, in 2023, I finished with a grade of **94/100**. 

I live with my family, in a small village near Arona (NO).

[👨‍💻] Since the last three years, I've been studying the **Java language☕**, improving my coding skills everyday and, of course, practising my problem solving and logic capabilities.

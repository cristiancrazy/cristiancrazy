<!-- General Informations Here -->
### Hi everyone!👋

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### General Biography
[🤷‍♂️] I am Cristian Capraro, actually a 20 years old CS student in [UniUPO](https://disit.uniupo.it/it) (VC, Italy).

I was an IT student of [ITIS Fauser](https://www.fauser.edu) (sited in Novara, Italy) for five years and, in 2023, I finished with a grade of **94/100**. 

I live with my family, in a small village near Arona (NO).

[👨‍💻] Since the last four years, I've been studying the **Java language☕**, improving my coding skills everyday and, of course, practising my problem solving and logic capabilities.

### My Skills on Programming Languages 

Actually, during my degree and as a CS Student, I have studied the following languages:

- [📖] Software low-level **Microcode**,  just like `MicroAssembly`

- [📖] **C** and **C++**, and some other related C-like languages;

- [📖] **PHP** and a bit of *Java* for the web application part.

- [📖] MySQL-related Database **SQL Language**

- [📖] And the **Cisco Configuration Language** for network-specific appliances.

On my own, I have studied:

- [👨‍💻] **Java** and its hidden behaviours: studied for 4 years and used in a large variety of my project / gists as the main language.
  - Networking Applications, Secure Sockets, Mutual Certificate Authentication and Management, Multithreading and concurrency.
  - BouncyCastle Security Framework
  - Graphical environment with AWT, Swing and JFX.
  - Java Database (JDBC) for MySQL, UCA for reading and modifying MS Access DB.
  - Java HyperSQL Database Implementation.
  - Physical Security with the internal SmartCardIO and APDU commands.
  - **Mobile application development**
  - And more...

- [👨‍💻] Recently approached **GoLang**, and already used in some volunteering and personal projects.
  - HTTP Server with Websockets implementation
  - Image and Video Processing
  - Personal intrusion detection and prevention system, DoS detection and mitigating system
  - Authentication, Time OTP Security implementation, SmartCard reading and writing implementation through the APDU.

- [👨‍💻] Web-related languages and Frameworks: **PHP**, **JAVASCRIPT**, **HTML** and **CSS**, **BS5** and **UIKIT**

- [👨‍💻] Scripting languages like **NSIS** scripting, **BASH SCRIPT (.sh)** and **POWERSHELL SCRIPT (.ps1)**.

- [👨‍💻] Used on MCUs: primarily C-like languages with **Arduino Sketching**, **Microchip Studio** (AVR Studio),
  and **Micropython**. 

- [👨‍💻] Language not used recently, but that I know: **LUA**, **C#**, **Visual Basic**.

### Actually Working On

#### BiblioDGN Project (Self-Hosted Web application)

I am actually working on some volunteering project, such as the project named **BiblioDNG**.
This project is a web application, made primarily in Go and HTML Templates, which enables
a specific category of users to register and manage a *Town Local Library*.

This Project will become public available, under the MIT license, 
as soon as we (me and my collabotors) finish the first stable version (v1.0).

In our release schedule, it will happens on June or July 2024.

### Archived Old Projects
- [🔭] [Mediaticon](https://mediaticon.rootlet.it) - was a free-to-use but closed-source project, commissioned
to the Rootlet team by a company. 
The complete suite featured information crawlers (written in Python), a program schedulator
(written in Java), the main program (written in C#) and some installation script (written in shell / ps1 script).

<!-- General Informations Here -->
### Hi everyone!👋
[🤷‍♂️] I am Cristian Capraro, actually, an 18 years old, CS student of [ITIS Fauser](https://www.fauser.edu) (sited in Novara, Italy). I live with my family, in a small village located near lake Maggiore.

[👨‍💻] Since the last three years, I've been studying the **Java programming language☕**, improving my coding skills everyday and, of course, practising my problem solving and logic capabilities.

### Certifications
[📖] Since May 2022, I am certified ITE technician by [Cisco Networking Academy](https://www.netacad.com/). I choosed to certify myself not only because I think it's useful, but because I love **computer networks** and electronics. 

[📖] I am also certified in English, at B1 level, by [Cambridge English](https://www.cambridgeenglish.org/). English is a must in every IT sector, and I will continue to improve my language capabilities.
